HexChat-Scripts
===============
Some of my HexChat scripts. Those in the 'Other' folder are not commented yet,
and/or need improvement.

Installation:
=============
Copy the script.py to your path_to_HexChat_config/plugins directory.

Notes:
=====
* Some scripts expect data in /home/germain/.config/hexchat/addons/data/
* Other scripts create data there.
* You will need to change the path in both cases, and provide your own data in
  the first case.
* You can find my own data folder, along with the rest of my scripts, synced
  directly to my dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o1lf8hv692h30aq/A64b3z2frt
